goalDescription : This program demonstrate how to declare an array and assign values to it , then iterate over the array and print
                  the sum of all the arrays's values.

output: 15

          answer1: arr is the declared array variable of integer values
          question2: what is the size of the declared array?
          answer2: the array arr has assigned 5 values.

         question1: What is the initial value of the local variable sum?
         answer1: the sum is initiliazed with the value 0.
         question2:what is the value of length variable inside the for loop?
         answer2:  5
         question3: what is the maximun value of variable  i in the for loop ?
         answer3:4
         question4: what are the number of iterations of the for loop?
         answer5: 5
         question5: what is the value of the sum variable after 3 iterations?
         answer5 : 6

         question1: Does the value of sum change after the execution of the for loop ?
         answer1: yes
         question2:is there an exception?
         answer2: in case the passed array is empty, the value of sum remains 0.

          question1: what is the number of the iterations of the for loop?
          answer1 : arr.length
          question2:why the value of i is less than the length of the array?
          answer2: because i starts at 0.
          question3: does the for loop execute if the array is empty and why?
          answer3: no. because the post condition of the loop will be incorrect
