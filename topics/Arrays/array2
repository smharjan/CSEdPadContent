goalDescription : This program creates an array that represents the number of each vegetable type in a basket. Then iterates over the array and prints
                  the total number of the vegetables in the basket. This program demonstrates how to create an array, initialize it  with defined elements and how to process it.

          logical_steps_details: Declare an array representing a basket with 5 types of vegetables:3 tomatos, 2 potatos , 5 onions,4 carrots.
          question1: what is the name and the type of the declared array?
          answer1: arr is the declared array variable of integer values
          question2: what is the size of the declared array?
          answer2: the array arr has assigned 5 values.

            question1: Does the value of sum change after the execution of the for loop ?
            answer1: yes
            question2:is there an exception?
            answer2: in case the passed array is empty, the value of sum remains 0.

             logical_step_details: The loop iterate over the arrays' elements and sum up  them. Then prints the total number of vegetables in the basket.
             question1: what is the number of the iterations of the for loop?
             answer1 : 5
             question2:why the value of i is less than the length of the array?
             answer2: because i starts at 0.
             question3: does the for loop execute if the array is empty and why?
             answer3: no. because the post condition of the loop will be incorrect
